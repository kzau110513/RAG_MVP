Climate change refers to significant changes in global temperatures and weather patterns over time. Human activities, especially the burning of fossil fuels, have been identified as major contributors to climate change.

The Paris Agreement is a landmark international treaty signed in 2015 that aims to limit global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial levels.

Renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydroelectric power play a crucial role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
